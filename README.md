# GECK MCP for New Vegas — 0.4.0 Beta

**0.4.0 Beta is a major upgrade:** the bundled companion source lets your AI agent **enter in-game console commands** and **query live mod indices/load-order prefixes with GetModIndex**, including explicitly named loaded plugins. Typed inventory and equipped-condition readback help verify effects; resumable compilation improves the editor workflow.

**Still in Beta:** Windows live tests passed, but broader GECK workloads and remote-session validation remain open. Use disposable plugins and saves.

**Source-only download: no precompiled DLL or EXE.** Your AI agent can follow [local setup and compilation](docs/SOURCE-SETUP.md) to build the helper and optional xNVSE companion. [Download 0.4.0 Beta](https://github.com/2Shay96/geck-mcp-nv/releases/tag/v0.4.0-beta.1).

Previous stable prototype: **0.3.0** on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/99851?tab=files) and [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/2Shay96/geck-mcp-nv/releases/tag/v0.3.0). GitHub gets development updates first, so main may be newer than the Nexus download. See [upgrading and release checks](docs/RELEASING.md).

**Let an AI agent (Claude, Codex or any MCP client) build and edit Fallout: New Vegas plugins and drive the GECK.**

> ⚠️ **Work-in-progress prototype.** The `geck` bridge is tested end to end on **Windows 11** with the vanilla
> Steam GECK (see [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)). Linux/Proton is written but untested. Read the status table
> first, back up your Data folder, and use a throwaway plugin.

## What's inside

An optional read-only xNVSE companion adds automatic quest snapshots and comparisons
without console typing or screen control. See [setup and validation limits](bridge/docs/AUTOMATIC-RUNTIME.md).

The bridge now exposes **44 tools**, including four user-driven vanilla runtime
diagnostics tools and a shared CLI. They prepare safe query batches, collect fresh
checkpoint output, compare values and evaluate declarative assertions. Windows vanilla item-count/delta/error capture passed on 18 October; see [usage and limits](bridge/docs/MCP-QUICKSTART.md#runtime-diagnostics-29-bridge-tools).

| Folder | MCP server | What it does | Tested |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`bridge/`](bridge/README.md) | `geck` (44 tools) | **Builds whole plugins from a JSON spec** (records, cells, placed objects, stable FormIDs) without GECK. **Compiles scripts with GECK's own compiler** and caches the bytecode. Loads plugins in GECK, checks cells against the build, sets models, saves with backups. Also actor photos and animated sprite billboards. | ✅ Windows 11 (vanilla GECK) · ❓ Linux/Proton · also tested on Mac via CrossOver |
| [`windows/`](windows/README.md) | `geck_nv` (46 tools) | **FNV port of [GECK MCP for Fallout 3](https://github.com/maksimka2432fr23/codex-skill-mcp-fallout3)** by maksimka2432fr23. Windows UI automation: launch GECK through NVSE, navigate Cell View and the Object Window, drag objects into the Render Window, load order, transactions and rollback, placed-reference patches. | ❓ Windows (not yet run against the FNV GECK) |

You can run either server on its own, or both at once (their tool names don't overlap).

## Why it exists

The GECK is a 2010 GUI editor with no scripting interface. Other AI modding kits edit plugins through xEdit
and leave the GECK to you. This project gives an agent the GECK itself: loading, verifying, saving and
compiling scripts. It also adds an offline builder, so the agent can write a whole mod as a readable spec.

It is being used to make a real mod: *Salvatore Ganacci*, a sprite-based creature boss with its own skeleton,
scripts and quests. It was built from a spec and compiled through the bridge, and the boss already pursues and
fights the player in game.

## Quick start

1. Read [`bridge/README.md`](bridge/README.md) (any OS), [`windows/README.md`](windows/README.md) (Windows), or both.
2. Install Python 3.12+ and create a virtual environment in the folder you'll use.
3. Nexus download: build the GECK helper once with `build_helper.py` (see [`bridge/README.md`](bridge/README.md), step 3).
   Release downloads contain source only: **no DLL or EXE**. Build the helper locally; see [AI-assisted source setup](docs/SOURCE-SETUP.md). Optional console/telemetry DLLs are built locally for your project.
4. Register the server in your MCP client (examples are in each README).
5. First prompt: *"Run geck_status (or geck_doctor) and tell me what you see. Don't change anything."*

## Requirements

- Fallout: New Vegas and its GECK (Steam: Library → Tools). This package contains **no** game files, GECK or ESM data.
  Each user builds their own master index locally.
- Python 3.12+ and an MCP client.
- Optional automatic quest diagnostics: native Windows Steam FNV 1.4.0.525, xNVSE 6.4.9 or newer 6.x, and Zig 0.14.1 to build a companion for your project. See [setup](bridge/docs/AUTOMATIC-RUNTIME.md). Vanilla batch diagnostics need no extender.
- Optional: NVSE for `geck_launch(via_nvse=true)`. PyFFI for sprite tools installs with `bridge/requirements.lock.txt`.

## Safety

- Every tool that writes makes backups first. Read-only tools are labelled.
- The bridge refuses to load plugins over unsaved GECK work. The Windows server refuses file edits while GECK or the game runs.
- Windows UI tools move your mouse and type. Don't use the PC while they run.
- Report problems. Don't trust results you haven't checked in GECK or in game.

## Status and roadmap

The [v1.0 vision](docs/V1-VISION.md) records the proposed Windows build/compile/playtest/fix workflow and future release presentation requirements.

v0.3.0 adds runtime diagnostics to the existing bridge server and remains a prototype release.
The v0.2 series fixed what broke while building a real mod on Windows: tools now work
through Claude's Cowork device proxy, hidden GECK windows are restored, stale recovery barriers clear themselves after
a GECK restart, and the Render Window can be captured on Windows. Next steps: a GECK Extender pass, running the
`windows/` server against the FNV GECK, a Linux/Proton test, DLC masters, and one combined installer. See
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Resumable compilation and readiness (0.4.0 candidate)

Build/install/load through the bridge, then use `geck_compile_start`,
`geck_compile_status` and `geck_compile_resume`. The shared CLI is
`bridge/compile_scripts.py`. Pending/blocked retain work and the editor reservation;
only verified means saved-script/cache/rebuild/install checks passed. Quiet UI
polling or input dispatch is provisional. Unknown prompts require review.
See [compile recovery](bridge/docs/MCP-QUICKSTART.md#resumable-compilation-040-candidate).

`geck_runtime_readiness` separates per-adapter support and installed files from
fresh process/build/mapping proof. Automatic sampling supports a single quest's
variables; item counts and reference state use vanilla manual batches. Setup
preflight previews exact files/backups and restart checks. No compiler download,
DLL install or console command runs without an explicit request.

## In-game console companion (0.4.0 Beta)

The bundled companion source provides opt-in `geck_console_setup`, `geck_console_readiness`,
`geck_console_query`, `geck_console_execute`, `geck_console_status` and `geck_console_release` tools.
Read-only telemetry is unchanged. See [console setup, commands and outcome semantics](bridge/docs/CONSOLE-COMMANDS.md).
Real FNV console smoke acceptance passed; broader GECK/Shadow gates remain
pending. This published version remains Beta.
